        University felt like a group project no one was managing. Notes were in
        WhatsApp, deadlines and dates in someone’s head, and past questions &
        course materials in a Google Drive only the chosen ones had access to.
        It was disorganized and inefficient. <br />
        <br /> There were tools out there, sure, but none that felt like they were
        made for us students. No one single app really worked for the way students
        actually operate. So I made something for students, by a student. <br />
        <br /> The goal wasn’t to build the next Silicon Valley edtech unicorn. It
        was simpler than that: build a system I wish I had back when I was in Uni.
        A digital toolkit for students - where everything you need to survive uni
        is in one place. Notes, deadlines, past questions, services - all organized,
        accessible, and stress-free. <br />
        <br /> Because students shouldn’t be spending half their time scrambling
        for resources or decoding cryptic group chats. Study House is about flipping
        that narrative to bring more order and clarity to every uni students life.
        To help students focus on what they actually came to school to do. To learn,
        make memories and enjoy some of the best years of their lives.

        Nothing was technically broken - but everything felt like it was
        designed to suite as many use cases as possible. We had different
        generic apps for tasks, notes and calendars. It wasn’t that the tools
        were bad. Most were designed for productivity gurus, not made
        specifically to suite the needs of students looking for on-campus
        services, juggling assignments, group work, surprise quizzes, and power
        outages. <br /> What we needed was simple: one space where students had access
        to resources, services and tools that get them from A to B with minimal headaches.
        Tools that are well researched, optimized and designed for their specific
        use case.

        I designed and built Study House. From initial research, wireframes,
        prototypes and testing to software development. <br />
        <br /> Study House helps Ghanaian university students (and maybe one day,
        students across Africa) stay on top of classes, find helpful campus resources
        and services, stay organized, and even earn on the side - all without jumping
        between five apps and twenty tabs. <br />
        <br /> Think of it as your uni command center. Need notes? It’s in there.
        Deadlines? Tracked. Laundry pickup? Sorted. If you were Dora the Explorer,
        Study House is your backpack — packed with exactly what you need, minus the
        cartoon map. <br />
        <br /> I designed the brand, built the frontend with Astro + Vue, and plugged
        it into a backend-as-a-service so I could focus on what mattered: a clean,
        calm, zero-fluff experience that just works.

        What UX principles guided the design of Study House?
      </h2>
      <div class="text-tertiary">
        <p>
          This wasn’t a UI-first project - it was a behavior-first one. I had to
          respect how students actually behaved(scattered, stressed, and short
          on time) and model the application around that behavior instead of
          fighting against it or trying to change it. <br />
          <br /> The UX is built for quick wins and fewer taps. No deep menus. No
          tiny buttons. No features they have to “figure out.” The flow is natural:
          open the app, see what matters, do what you came to do, and bounce. Need
          past questions? They’re right there. Need a job? Browse and apply in seconds.
          Study House doesn’t try to force new habits - it meets students where they
          already are. The focus was on: <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-[18px]">
          <li>Cognitive load reduction – One screen, fewer decisions.</li>
          <li>
            Progressive disclosure – Only show what’s needed when it’s needed.
          </li>
          <li>Predictable flow – The user never feels lost or surprised.</li>
          <li>
            Accessibility for context – Designed with low-connectivity users and
            fragmented schedules in mind.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <br />
          <br />
          I validated early wireframes with students, stripped away what didn’t serve
          them, and doubled down on what did. Study House works because it’s made
          for how students already operate, not how we wish they did.

          I won't say this is final but it's a positive base to build from.
          Study House brings all the chaos of student life into one calm,
          useful, well-designed place. It solves real problems students face -
          not hypotheticals - and every feature is built around how students
          actually think, behave, and survive on campus.

          This wasn’t a feature cram fest. It was about thoughtful and well researched
          architecture. It was about ensuring every piece of the product earned its
          spot on the screen.

          That design isn’t about making things pretty - it’s about making
          things make sense.Building Study House sharpened my ability to turn
          complex, overlapping needs into clear and easy to understand flows not
          just for the user, but for performance, scale, and sustainability. <br
          /><br /> I got better at writing interface copy that actually connects,
          not just instructs. At balancing speed and polish - shipping fast without
          shipping junk. At building a Vue-powered app that stays lightweight, modular,
          and maintainable without turning it into a loading screen. And most importantly,
          I learned how to step out of my own bubble. <br /><br /> This wasn’t a
          solo genius moment. It was conversations, criticisms, prototype tests,
          and unfiltered feedback - all of which pushed the product into a shape
          that actually works. Listening, validating, and refining at every stage
          made the final design tighter, smarter, and more grounded in real behavior.
          <br /><br /> I also learned how to make multiple layers of functionality
          - academic tools, support systems, financial features - feel like one unified
          experience, not a Frankenstein app. That kind of cohesion isn’t easy. But
          it’s what separates a good product from a forgettable one. In short:

        <ul class="list-disc pl-[18px]">
          <li>Build with your users, not just for them</li>

        Because students shouldn’t have to choose between surviving school and
        actually learning. Because we’ve upgraded how people bank, shop, work -
        even date - but somehow left the student experience stuck in the past. <br
        />
        <br /> I built Study House for students like me: juggling lectures, part-time
        jobs, side hustles, and the chaos in between. When you’ve lived the problem,
        you stop guessing what matters - you know. <br />
        <br /> And what matters isn’t just better tech - it’s a better experience.
        Something that respects your time, understands your needs, and makes academic
        life feel less like a mess to manage and more like a system that supports
        you. <br /><br /> Study House wasn’t built to impress. It was built to help.
        To make student life feel a little more manageable - and a lot more human.

          Study House isn’t done - not even close. This version is the
          foundation, not the final form. <br />
          <br /> Students are constantly adapting, and the product has to keep up.
          That means more listening, more testing, and more refining - always building
          with students, not just for them. <br /><br /> The vision? To turn Study
          House into that one student who always has it together - calm, organized,
          somehow knows the exam venue, and even has snacks. In product terms: smarter
          systems, deeper personalization, and tools that genuinely improve student
          life. <br /><br />
        </p>
        <div>

            <li>AI-generated study plans that adapt to your pace</li>
            <li>
              Smarter verification for student services (no more “is this
              legit?” moments)
            </li>
            <li>Built-in career tools to prep students beyond school</li>
            <li>
              Potential partnerships with schools to integrate real-time

            </li>
            <li>
              Community-driven features that let students help each other
              succeed
            </li>
            <br />
          </ul>
          Whatever makes student life less chaotic and more intentional - that’s
          the roadmap.
