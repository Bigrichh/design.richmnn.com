      <p class="text-tertiary">
        When you walk into EyeContact Vision Care, you immediately feel the
        calm, clean professionalism. But their website didn’t reflect any of
        that. It felt outdated, cluttered, and didn’t match the high standards
        they clearly set in their physical space. That disconnect made it clear:
        the digital experience needed to step up and meet the bar.

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-[48px]">
      <h2 class="text-secondary">Did you do any research?</h2>
      <p class="text-tertiary">
        No formal research this time around — it was mostly observational. I
        leaned on best practices and design intuition, walking through the
        existing site like a potential customer and spotting pain points: weak
        branding, confusing navigation, an underwhelming store, and a booking
        flow that needed clarity.

      <h2 class="text-secondary">What was broken?</h2>
      <p class="text-tertiary">
        Everything felt a little off. The homepage was trying to say too much at
        once. Navigation was cluttered. Important actions like booking an
        appointment or shopping for frames weren’t front and center. The
        branding wasn’t strong — no logo in sight, inconsistent typography, and
        not enough color hierarchy. Even the blog felt like an afterthought.

      <h2 class="text-secondary">Why did you design it this way?</h2>
      <p class="text-tertiary">
        The goal was to design a site that felt as clean and confident as the
        physical practice. That meant simplifying everything — clearer CTAs,
        more breathing room, better typography, and a more intuitive structure.
        We weren’t reinventing the wheel; we were just doing the basics, but
        doing them really well.

            Booking: Gave appointment scheduling its own flow for clarity.

            Navigation & Footer: Cleaned up layout, reinforced branding, made it
            mobile-friendly.

          <li>
            Overall visual system: Chose better typography, improved spacing,

            brand.

        In today’s world, the website is often the first impression.
        EyeContact’s physical space already nailed the in-person experience — it
        was time the digital one matched it. The redesign now builds trust,
        reflects professionalism, and makes it easy for users to take action.

      <h2 class="text-secondary">What’s next?</h2>
      <p class="text-tertiary">
        The redesigned website is already live and functioning well, but there’s
        still room to refine. Future plans could include integrating a more
        seamless customer portal, supporting virtual consultations, and
        optimizing SEO to expand reach. But for now, the goal was simple: make
        the digital feel as good as the physical — and I did just that.
