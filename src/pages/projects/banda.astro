          >Banda is a Ghanaian clothing brand built around culture, identity,
          and community. Banda isn’t tied to just one category or style and
          although the designs reflect the energy of the streets, the brand’s
          spirit is deeply community-driven.</span

        <span class="block">
          Banda wanted an experience that felt as elevated as the clothes they
          were putting out. The reference point? Think Nike, Balenciaga, Gucci —
          web experiences that let the product shine by stripping away the
          noise.

        <span class="block">
          They didn’t want a typical online store. They wanted a canvas —
          something minimalist and premium, where the clothes and community
          could take center stage.

        When the product is strong, you don’t need to over-design. Sometimes the
        best thing you can do is get out of the way. With Banda, the job wasn’t
        to decorate — it was to create space.
