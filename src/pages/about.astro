      <p class="w-full text-primary">
        A quick look at how I think, work, and build across design, code, and
        collaboration. <br />
        <br />
        These are the questions I get most, and the answers that quietly guide everything
        I do.

        <h2 class="text-primary">Q1: How did the hybrid role come about?</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          I started on the engineering path, drawn to building things that solve
          problems. But quickly realized that functionality needs form.
          Interfaces need intention and most often no one got the translation
          from design to code right. So I leaned into design. It wasn’t about
          changing lanes. It was about building fluency across both. Today, I
          think like a developer, work like a designer, and ship like someone
          who understands both.
        </p>

      <!-- Q2 -->

        <h2 class="text-primary">
          Q2: How does your coding background shape your design?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          It grounds it. Knowing how things are built means my designs are more
          implementation-aware — structured, responsive, and considerate of edge
          cases. It also means I can speak dev fluently, bridge teams, and
          design with real constraints in mind from the start.
        </p>

      <!-- Q3 -->

      >
        <h2 class="text-primary">
          Q3: What’s something people often misunderstand about design?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          That it has to be flashy to be good. It doesn’t. Some of the best
          design is almost invisible and never calls attention to itself, just
          quietly making everything else make sense. That’s not boring. That’s
          discipline.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Q4 -->
      <div
        class="w-full p-[32px] flex flex-col gap-[4px] items-start border-[0.5px] border-bdprimary"
      >
        <h2 class="text-primary">
          Q4: What does your design process look like?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          It’s fluid. Some days I’m sketching low-fidelity flows, other times
          I’m remixing an old file in Figma because the structure works. I lean
          on reference, reuse patterns when they still hold, and know when to
          reinvent but only if it earns its keep. My process is fast,
          responsive, and always built to serve the problem, not the portfolio.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Q5 -->
      <div
        class="w-full p-[32px] flex flex-col gap-[4px] items-start border-[0.5px] border-bdprimary"
      >
        <h2 class="text-primary">
          Q5: Do you follow a specific methodology like Design Thinking or
          Double Diamond?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          I see them as reference points, not rules. Every project has its own
          rhythm. Some need structure, others need speed. What I care about is
          getting to clarity: understanding the problem, building context fast,
          and choosing the right shape of process for the challenge.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Q6 -->
      <div
        class="w-full p-[32px] flex flex-col gap-[4px] items-start border-[0.5px] border-bdprimary"
      >
        <h2 class="text-primary">
          Q6: How do you balance creativity with constraints?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          That’s where the work lives. Creativity is sharper when it knows its
          boundaries. My background in front-end development helps here. I’m
          always thinking in real systems: performance, scalability,
          responsiveness. It’s not about just pushing pixels. It’s about pushing
          in the right direction, with all the constraints accounted for.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Q7 -->
      <div
        class="w-full p-[32px] flex flex-col gap-[4px] items-start border-[0.5px] border-bdprimary"
      >
        <h2 class="text-primary">Q7: Do you have a signature design style?</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          I lean toward minimalism and not in the trendy, sterile sense, but in
          how I strip away the unnecessary to let the real story shine. I don’t
          design to make things look like “me”; I design to make them feel like
          the brand. If there’s a common thread in my work, it’s clarity,
          restraint, and that subtle final polish that makes something well
          thought out even in the invisible corners.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Q8 -->
      <div
        class="w-full p-[32px] flex flex-col gap-[4px] items-start border-[0.5px] border-bdprimary"
      >
        <h2 class="text-primary">Q8: How do you approach speed?</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          I aim to build something real quickly: a screen, a flow, a mock.
          Something the team can react to. Not because speed is always the
          answer, but because momentum matters. The sooner we have something
          tangible, the sooner we can refine. Not haste. Just intentional,
          iterative movement.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Q9 -->
      <div
        class="w-full p-[32px] flex flex-col gap-[4px] items-start border-[0.5px] border-bdprimary"
      >
        <h2 class="text-primary">Q9: Where do you draw inspiration from?</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          Context first. The problem tells me where to look. Sometimes it’s
          reference. Sometimes it’s books, motion, architecture, old
          screenshots. I stay observant and steal like an artist. What matters
          isn’t the input but in how I translate it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Q10 -->
      <div
        class="w-full p-[32px] flex flex-col gap-[4px] items-start border-[0.5px] border-bdprimary"
      >
        <h2 class="text-primary">
          Q10: Do you work better solo or with a team?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          Both, depending on the phase. I move fast and think deeply on my own,
          but the best results happen when ideas are challenged, sharpened, and
          refined with others. I don’t believe in lone genius. I believe in
          collaboration that respects the process and the people.
        </p>

      <!-- Q11 -->
      <div
        class="w-full p-[32px] flex flex-col gap-[4px] items-start border-[0.5px] border-bdprimary"
      >
        <h2 class="text-primary">
          Q11: What do you value most in collaborators?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          Clarity. Curiosity. And honesty. The willingness to challenge ideas
          without ego. Developers who care about experience. PMs who respect the
          mess of creativity. Founders who trust but still question. I’ve done
          my best work in rooms where ideas compete, not egos.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Q12 -->
      <div
        class="w-full p-[32px] flex flex-col gap-[4px] items-start border-[0.5px] border-bdprimary"
      >
        <h2 class="text-primary">
          Q12: What happens when a project doesn’t go as planned?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          We pivot. I don’t get precious about early ideas. If something’s not
          working, we change it. What matters is getting to the best outcome.
          Good process is flexible. Good teams know when to shift.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-primary">Where it all comes together:</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          This mindset in working across design and development, balancing speed
          with clarity, and building with both users and systems in mind shapes
          everything I touch. Whether it’s a founder’s first product, a redesign
          with scale in mind, or a concept built to explore new ground, I treat
          every project like a collaboration between idea, execution, and
          experience.
