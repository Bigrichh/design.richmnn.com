        Q1: What does your design process look like?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-tertiary">
        Honestly, I‚Äôd say my design process is somewhere between organized chaos
        and inspired recycling. I don‚Äôt believe in rigid frameworks. Sometimes
        I‚Äôm sketching low-fidelity ideas, sometimes I‚Äôm jumping straight into
        Figma with a reference or an old file I can remix. A lot of my process
        is built on recognizing patterns ‚Äî a layout I‚Äôve seen before, a
        structure that worked in the past or a component I‚Äôve used 10 times that
        still works. I‚Äôm mostly not reinventing the wheel, only picking and
        choosing when to reinvent it‚Äîand maybe make it a little prettier.

        Diamond?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-tertiary">
        Not really. I mean, I get the value of those models, but I treat them
        more like reference points I use to build my own custom roadmaps. Each
        project has its own texture, and forcing every idea through the same
        funnel might not be very realistic. Sometimes you start with research,
        sometimes you just know what needs to be done and jump into prototyping.
        It‚Äôs all fluid.

        Q3: How do you balance creativity and constraints?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-tertiary">
        This is where my frontend knowledge is advantageous. I‚Äôm always
        thinking, "Can this be built? Will this scale? Is this
        performance-friendly?" So even while I‚Äôm pushing the visuals or doing
        something experimental, I have this little dev whisper in my ear asking
        these questions. Constraints don‚Äôt limit me‚Äîthey actually sharpen the
        work and make collaboration better.

      <h2 class="text-secondary">Q4: Do you have a signature style?</h2>
      <p class="text-tertiary">
        Nope. I kind of avoid that on purpose. I‚Äôm not trying to inject me into
        every project(sometimes I do). But the goal is mostly to extract the
        essence of the idea, the brand and the people behind it‚Äînot make it look
        like it came out of my personal template. That said, my only ‚Äústyle‚Äù is
        simplicity, intention, and a little edge where it fits. I work hard to
        get to the kind of simplicity that‚Äôs not just minimal, but meaningful.
        Disappearing into the background and letting the brand speak. That‚Äôs the
        goal. Not aesthetics for aesthetics‚Äô sake. But something well researched
        and built so thoughtfully‚Äîeven the back panel nobody sees is solid wood.

          complex... but if you keep going and peel the layers, you get to
          something elegant.‚Äù A simple approach: build fast, learn fast, refine.

        Q7: How does your coding background influence your design?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-tertiary">
        Massively. Knowing how code works means I naturally design with
        constraints in mind. My designs are structured, responsiveness aware,
        and have implementation realities baked in from the jump. The fluency in
        both languages helps me speak between dev and design without needing a
        translator. Performance, hierarchy, spacing‚Äî all of this is the
        experience and the experience is the product.

      <p class="text-tertiary">
        I thrive in both. Solo, I move fast, explore, and go deep. With a team,
        I grow. I love bouncing ideas off people, getting challenged, and seeing
        blind spots. The sweet spot is usually starting alone to generate
        momentum, then syncing with others to refine and improve.

        I‚Äôm okay with scrapping things that don‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm not perfect. If

        early. Process is messy, and that‚Äôs normal. The goal is always forward.

        <span class="block"

          things but those functional things had interfaces that needed to be
          designed and not just templated. So I turned to studying design‚Äîalmost
          as a necessity. I wanted to be able to cover the full spectrum from
          design to dev solo. I picked up a Figma course and the journey to self
          taught designer began. It slowed down my software engineering track
          slightly (because you‚Äôre learning two different things - technical and
          creative - simultaneously) but I have zero regrets because now I don‚Äôt
          just think like a developer‚ÄîI think like a product.

        Honesty. The ability to say "I don‚Äôt think this would work but let‚Äôs

        experience, with PMs who respect creative mess, and with founders who
        trust but also challenge. The best work I‚Äôve done came from spaces where
        everyone had a stake and wasn‚Äôt afraid to speak up, learn and challenge
        standard conventions.
