        Hi, I’m Richmann. <br />
        I design interfaces that feel simple, functional, and human. My Strength
        lies in simplifying complex structures and translating that simplicity into
        clear, intentional design. I do this by blending UI sensibility, UX thinking
        and a builder’s mindset.<br /><br />
        I'm currently shaping digital experiences @ Utopia Tech as Design Engineer(part
        designer, part frontend developer) working across web and mobile.<br
        /><br /> This portfolio is a glimpse into how I think and build. If it resonates,
        I’d love to talk. <br /><br />

        P.S.: You might be here for a bit. Play some music while you explore.
        There’s something for everyone. Cheers.
      </p>
